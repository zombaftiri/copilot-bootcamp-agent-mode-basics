### :keyboard: Activity: Adding Unit Tests for Backend Delete API

In this exercise, you'll use GitHub Copilot's Agent mode to implement backend unit tests for delete api.

### :keyboard: Activity: Use Agent mode to create unit tests for the delete api

Let's add the backend unit tests for the delete api created in the previous lessons.

1. Open the **Copilot** chat panel and switch to **Agent** mode using the dropdown menu.

1. In the Copilot chat input field, use your own words to ask Copilot to add unit tests for delete api.
   - For example, you might say: _"Add backend unit tests for the delete endpoint"_.
   - The exact wording is up to youâ€”just make sure your intent is clear!

1. Copilot will analyze your codebase and add unit tests for the delete endpoint in packages/backend/\__tests\__/app.test.js.

1. When Copilot finishes making the changes, review what was modified:
   - In the backend (`packages/backend/__tests__/app.test.js`), you should see unit tests added for delete endpoint

1. When prompted by Copilot, run the backend tests to make sure they all pass. If you see any errors ask Copilot to fix the errors.

1. Keep the changes that copilot implemented.

1. Commit and push to the `feature/test` branch.

### Success Criteria

To complete this exercise successfully:
- The codebase should have unit tests for DELETE endpoint in `packages/backend/__tests__/app.test.js` 
- You may need to move and rename the test file generated to the location specified above for the validations to succeed.
- The unit tests should runs successfully.

If you encounter any issues, you can:
- Ask Copilot to fix specific problems
- Check the developer console for any errors
