# General Guidelines

This document outlines the basic principles and best practices for all code in the project.

## Code Quality Principles

### 1. Readability

- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Use comments for complex logic or non-obvious decisions
- Organize code in a logical manner with related functionality grouped together
- Keep functions and methods focused on a single responsibility

### 2. Maintainability

- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Break complex operations into smaller, more manageable functions
- Use constants for magic numbers and strings
- Implement proper error handling with meaningful error messages
- Document public APIs and interfaces with JSDoc comments

### 3. Performance

- Be mindful of performance implications, especially in loops or data-heavy operations
- Avoid premature optimization, but consider scalability for critical paths
- Use appropriate data structures for the task at hand
- Consider caching strategies where appropriate

### 4. Security

- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before using it in HTML, SQL, or other contexts
- Handle sensitive data appropriately
- Don't expose internal implementation details unnecessarily
- Follow security best practices for authentication and authorization

## Project Structure

- Keep related files together
- Organize code by feature rather than by file type when appropriate
- Use clear and consistent file naming conventions
- Keep component files relatively small and focused

## Dependencies

- Add new dependencies only when necessary
- Prefer well-maintained and widely used libraries
- Document why a dependency was added
- Keep dependencies updated regularly

## Breaking Changes

- Avoid breaking changes to public APIs when possible
- When breaking changes are necessary, document them thoroughly
- Consider backward compatibility and migration paths

## Accessibility

- Ensure that all user interfaces are accessible
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines at minimum
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Use semantic HTML elements appropriately

## Collaboration

- Write code with clarity and maintainability in mind for future developers
- Document non-obvious decisions and design choices
- Be responsive to code reviews and feedback
- Ask questions when something isn't clear
